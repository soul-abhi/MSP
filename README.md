3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üîß Configuration

### YouTube API Setup

To enable real YouTube search functionality:

1. Get a YouTube Data API v3 key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
3. Replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in `src/main.ts` with your actual API key

**Note**: The app includes mock data for demonstration when no API key is provided.

### Audio Streaming

The current implementation uses placeholder audio URLs. For production use, you'll need:

1. A backend service to handle YouTube audio extraction
2. Proper licensing and legal compliance for audio streaming
3. Services like youtube-dl, yt-dlp, or similar tools
4. CORS-enabled audio hosting
